# Steps taken

Generate React App \
Read apollo graphql basic docs \
Install Apollo and check if we receive the data \
Get Bar Graph from visx examples \
Try to customize graph \
Fail \
Read D3 doc, get confused, but get a general ideea of how it works \
Parse the data we get from the API to achieve desired format \
Externalize Query call to a component \
Create a form for getting the sample size from user input \
Implement x Axis Group on graph \


# Challenges
The API fails in retrieving allPosts if there is no <count> supplied. Still not sure if this is by design.
If the count for the request is too large, it crashes the whole API. Did that twice :D

d3.js is a beast. Tried to run thru documentation and study some tutorial, but it seems like a steep learning curve. It looks like it's a very powerful tool for data visualization that can produce some amazing graphs. Will probably continue to dabble in it.


# To improve

Graph could use some pointer effects. \
Parser helper can probably be optimized. \
Some visual candy/styling. \

# Time spent
Documentation: ~ 4-6h \
Implementing: ~ 4h \
